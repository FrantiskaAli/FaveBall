## Description an usage
This app was created for purpose of keeping track of your favourite football team.
We used react with serval npm packages, such as Autocomplete npm package, fontawsome npm package, Bootstrap, Axios.
### Welcome Page
Only appears to user who has not visited us and has not chosen his favourite team. Has a top banner with basic information about what our website does and have autocomplete input field. Here you set your favourite team, which is then saved inside the local storage and used for website's api keys.</br>

## Installation
If you would like to add or improve our website, simply download our repository and run NPM install.
## Future development
There are many features we thought of ,but were unable to put in place due to short time frame of our project, these are for example saving multiples of teams through league table to then render on comparison page. Create graphs when comparing the two teams, so user can clearly see how the teams are doing without reading all the information one by one.
